# TriathlonApp
An app designed to add Workouts and Record Goals for Triathlon Workouts.

The ability to save, modify and delete workouts and goals is present. In addition, there are calculations to determine if a goal has been completed or not.

Three different versions of the applications have been created per the assesment guidelines
  - The original version built from scratch using ReactJS and JS
  - A version built using createReactApp using JS
  - A model of the code behind the app built in TypeScript (currently not useable but unit testing covers all branches and statements)
